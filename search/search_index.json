Stages The following diagram illustrates the auditing process First Line Defence The first line defence's work is undertaken by the authors of the artifact to be published and it is identified by an issue type Self Audit , created by the authors , that indicates: the source branch of the code that contains the code to be audited (the release branch) a checklist of actions that should be performed by the authors to mark the Self Audit completed Create a Self Audit issue Second Line Defence The second line defence's work is undertaken by internal auditors upon request by the authors or by the codeowners . It is identified by and issue of type Internal Audit , created by the authors . The authors should identify the source branch of the code that contains the code to be audited (the release branch) the audit plan for the artifact Create a Internal Audit issue Audits Internal audits are carried on by Tendermint members, the results of an audit should be submitted in an Audit issue, documenting the details of the audit process and results. Submit an Audit Third Line Defence The third line defence's work is undertaken by external auditors upon request by the authors or by the codeowners or managers . It is identified by and issue of type External Audit , created by the authors . The authors should identify the source branch of the code that contains the code to be audited (the release branch) the audit plan for the artifact The External audit must be approved by the codeowners or the managers since it requires budgeting outside the authors project scope. Create an External Audit issue Caveats the general project setup is a POC, any specific problems should be addressed by the codeowners the issue templates are provided as a current practical use cases for the codeowners benefit. this template can be used as a seed template for a auditing biz model for tendermint, in this case some roles will have to be adjusted","title":"Tendermint Audits Program"},{"location":"#tendermint-audits-program","text":"The repository introduces a practical setup to realize the auditing protocol for cosmos-sdk based projects outlined here","title":"Tendermint Audits Program"},{"location":"#general-setup","text":"The repository shall be overseen by the team that is delegated to oversee security within the Tendermint organization.
